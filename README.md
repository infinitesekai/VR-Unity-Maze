**VR Mobile App-Maze**

Developed with Unity 2019 and Google VR SDK

This is a VR prototype app inspired from Pac-Man.
It is a simpler version with some additional elements. 

The game is designed for the player to escape the maze by finding the exit while collecting coins and having some fun. 

The initial walking speed is slow which gives time to get used to the VR environment to prevent dizziness. 

**Coins, Stones, Treasures**
The player can walk in the maze and interact with objects inside. 

When the player collides with the coin and the coin disappear, this means that the player has collected this coin. Scores are not yet displayed in this prototype.

We can just relax while playing this game because there is no ghost behind us.

In video games, there will be treasure hunt that can be exciting. when the player finds any treasure, this gives a sense of achievement. In the prototype, we can try our luck as well. We can click on the stone. As the stone disappears, the lucky one will find the treasure box underneath.

**Statues**
Frequently, buffs are provided to strengthen the ability of the player. So we can see there are three statues in this game, we can see the colour change and revert when we move the pointer. 

The three statues will give the player blessings of natural elements. then, the player gets stronger with buffs added. 

Statue 1 turns green when we clicked on it to activate the statue this statue blesses with the power of the wind and double the walking speed.

Then, statue 2 turns yellow when activated indicate the earth element and a red ball appearrs. when we click on the ball, it will be teleported to a random position.  Uncertainty is an interesting element in games and we look for possibility.  Randomness gives possibility to collect the coin from distance when the trisphrere collides with the coin. 

Statue 3 is violet when activated and it represent electro power.  So we can say it is the speed. The player is teleported to a position closer to the exit. When we go closer and we see the 3D word Congratulations! on it.

The game ends when the player reaches the exit and presses on the corresponding button. 

Overall, this VR game prototype adds more fun to the Pac-Man game like we have buffs from the statues and we can also relax and play at our own pace.
